Just writing this down so I don't get confused later on

Battle events (AfterHitEvent, CritChanceEvent, DamageModifyEvent, etc) are dispatched to the IBattleProvider that
is made for the battle. This provider then dispatches the event to all available and registered listeners.

Therefore, it is perfectly reasonable for the IBattleProvider to check the event that it is called to dispatch,
and modify values as needed. The prime example of this is BattleProvider, which handles the abilities of Pokemon
in relation to the event. Also, if this is done, the IBattleProvider may assume that it is the provider for the
battle, since this will almost always be true. If this is not the case, you need to reconsider how you're handling
events.
